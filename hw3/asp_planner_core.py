def solve_planning_problem_using_ASP(planning_problem,t_max):
    """
    If there is a plan of length at most t_max that achieves the goals of a given planning problem,
    starting from the initial state in the planning problem, returns such a plan of minimal length.
    If no such plan exists of length at most t_max, returns None.

    Finding a shortest plan is done by encoding the problem into ASP, calling clingo to find an
    optimized answer set of the constructed logic program, and extracting a shortest plan from this
    optimized answer set.

    NOTE: still needs to be implemented. Currently returns None for every input.

    Parameters:
        planning_problem (PlanningProblem): Planning problem for which a shortest plan is to be found.
        t_max (int): The upper bound on the length of plans to consider.

    Returns:
        (list(Expr)): A list of expressions (each of which specifies a ground action) that composes
        a shortest plan for planning_problem (if some plan of length at most t_max exists),
        and None otherwise.
