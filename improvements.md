# Improvements

The following things are to be improved (either for the remainder of the course, or for the next edition of the course).

- [ ] Adding more explicit comments describing the input/output format of functions to be implemented for the programming assignments.
- [ ] Setting up autotests so that they give more feedback on what goes right/wrong
- [ ] Use an ILP solver that works (well, or at all) with the Codegrade autotest environment (e.g., [GLPK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Linear_Programming_Kit)?)
- [ ] Add clearer (high-level, intuitive) explanations for the theoretical homework assignments, to make sure that it is clear what the task of the assignments is
